The intertwined processes of learning and evolution in complex environmental niches have resulted in a remarkable diversity of morphological forms. Moreover, many aspects of animal intelligence are deeply embodied in these evolved morphologies. However, the principles governing relations between environmental complexity, evolved morphology, and the learnability of intelligent control, remain elusive, partially due to the substantial challenge of performing large-scale in silico experiments on evolution and learning. We introduce Deep Evolutionary Reinforcement Learning (DERL): a novel computational framework which can evolve diverse agent morphologies to learn challenging locomotion and manipulation tasks in complex environments using only low level egocentric sensory information. Leveraging DERL we demonstrate several relations between environmental complexity, morphological intelligence and the learnability of control. First, environmental complexity fosters the evolution of morphological intelligence as quantified by the ability of a morphology to facilitate the learning of novel tasks. Second, evolution rapidly selects morphologies that learn faster, thereby enabling behaviors learned late in the lifetime of early ancestors to be expressed early in the lifetime of their descendants. In agents that learn and evolve in complex environments, this result constitutes the first demonstration of a long-conjectured morphological Baldwin effect. Third, our experiments suggest a mechanistic basis for both the Baldwin effect and the emergence of morphological intelligence through the evolution of morphologies that are more physically stable and energy efficient, and can therefore facilitate learning and control.

Many methods now exist for conditioning model outputs on task instructions, retrieved documents, and user-provided explanations and feedback. Rather than relying solely on examples of task inputs and outputs, these approaches allow for valuable additional data to be used in modeling with the purpose of improving model correctness and aligning learned models with human priors. Meanwhile, a growing body of evidence suggests that some language models can (1) store a large amount of knowledge in their parameters, and (2) perform inference over tasks in unstructured text to solve new tasks at test time. These results raise the possibility that, for some tasks, humans cannot explain to a model any more about the task than it already knows or could infer on its own. In this paper, we study the circumstances under which explanations of individual data points can (or cannot) improve modeling performance. In order to carefully control important properties of the data and explanations, we introduce a synthetic dataset for experiments, and we also make use of three existing datasets with explanations: e-SNLI, TACRED, SemEval. We first give a formal framework for the available modeling approaches, in which explanation data can be used as model inputs, as labels, or as a prior. After arguing that the most promising role for explanation data is as model inputs, we propose to use a retrieval-based method and show that it solves our synthetic task with accuracies upwards of 95%, while baselines without explanation data achieve below 65% accuracy. We then identify properties of datasets for which retrieval-based modeling fails. With the three existing datasets, we find no improvements from explanation retrieval. Drawing on our findings from our synthetic task, we suggest that at least one of six preconditions for successful modeling fails to hold with these datasets.

Our world is open-ended, non-stationary and constantly evolving; thus what we talk about and how we talk about it changes over time. This inherent dynamic nature of language comes in stark contrast to the current static language modelling paradigm, which constructs training and evaluation sets from overlapping time periods. Despite recent progress, we demonstrate that state-of-the-art Transformer models perform worse in the realistic setup of predicting future utterances from beyond their training period -- a consistent pattern across three datasets from two domains. We find that, while increasing model size alone -- a key driver behind recent progress -- does not provide a solution for the temporal generalization problem, having models that continually update their knowledge with new information can indeed slow down the degradation over time. Hence, given the compilation of ever-larger language modelling training datasets, combined with the growing list of language-model-based NLP applications that require up-to-date knowledge about the world, we argue that now is the right time to rethink our static language modelling evaluation protocol, and develop adaptive language models that can remain up-to-date with respect to our ever-changing and non-stationary world.

Perceptions of system competence and communicative ability, termed partner models, play a significant role in speech interface interaction. Yet we do not know what the core dimensions of this concept are. Taking a psycholexical approach, our paper is the first to identify the key dimensions that define partner models in speech agent interaction. Through a repertory grid study (N=21), a review of key subjective questionnaires, an expert review of resulting word pairs and an online study of 356 user of speech interfaces, we identify three key dimensions that make up a users' partner model: 1) perceptions toward competence and capability; 2) assessment of human-likeness; and 3) a system's perceived cognitive flexibility. We discuss the implications for partner modelling as a concept, emphasising the importance of salience and the dynamic nature of these perceptions.

# 5. Fast Concept Mapping: The Emergence of Human Abilities in Artificial  Neural Networks when Learning Embodied and Self-Supervised

Most artificial neural networks used for object detection and recognition are trained in a fully supervised setup. This is not only very resource consuming as it requires large data sets of labeled examples but also very different from how humans learn. We introduce a setup in which an artificial agent first learns in a simulated world through self-supervised exploration. Following this, the representations learned through interaction with the world can be used to associate semantic concepts such as different types of doors. To do this, we use a method we call fast concept mapping which uses correlated firing patterns of neurons to define and detect semantic concepts. This association works instantaneous with very few labeled examples, similar to what we observe in humans in a phenomenon called fast mapping. Strikingly, this method already identifies objects with as little as one labeled example which highlights the quality of the encoding learned self-supervised through embodiment using curiosity-driven exploration. It therefor presents a feasible strategy for learning concepts without much supervision and shows that through pure interaction with the world meaningful representations of an environment can be learned.
