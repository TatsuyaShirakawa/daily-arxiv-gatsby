Network science is the field dedicated to the investigation and analysis of complex systems via their representations as networks. We normally model such networks as graphs: sets of nodes connected by sets of edges and a number of node and edge attributes. This deceptively simple object is the starting point of never-ending complexity, due to its ability to represent almost every facet of reality: chemical interactions, protein pathways inside cells, neural connections inside the brain, scientific collaborations, financial relations, citations in art history, just to name a few examples. If we hope to make sense of complex networks, we need to master a large analytic toolbox: graph and probability theory, linear algebra, statistical physics, machine learning, combinatorics, and more.   This book aims at providing the first access to all these tools. It is intended as an "Atlas", because its interest is not in making you a specialist in using any of these techniques. Rather, after reading this book, you will have a general understanding about the existence and the mechanics of all these approaches. You can use such an understanding as the starting point of your own career in the field of network science. This has been, so far, an interdisciplinary endeavor. The founding fathers of this field come from many different backgrounds: mathematics, sociology, computer science, physics, history, digital humanities, and more. This Atlas is charting your path to be something different from all of that: a pure network scientist.

We introduce a new pretraining approach for language models that are geared to support multi-document NLP tasks. Our cross-document language model (CD-LM) improves masked language modeling for these tasks with two key ideas. First, we pretrain with multiple related documents in a single input, via cross-document masking, which encourages the model to learn cross-document and long-range relationships. Second, extending the recent Longformer model, we pretrain with long contexts of several thousand tokens and introduce a new attention pattern that uses sequence-level global attention to predict masked tokens, while retaining the familiar local attention elsewhere. We show that our CD-LM sets new state-of-the-art results for several multi-text tasks, including cross-document event and entity coreference resolution, paper citation recommendation, and documents plagiarism detection, while using a significantly reduced number of training parameters relative to prior works.

We present Knowledge Enhanced Multimodal BART (KM-BART), which is a Transformer-based sequence-to-sequence model capable of reasoning about commonsense knowledge from multimodal inputs of images and texts. We extend the popular BART architecture to a multi-modal model. We design a new pretraining task to improve the model performance on Visual Commonsense Generation task. Our pretraining task improves the Visual Commonsense Generation performance by leveraging knowledge from a large language model pretrained on an external knowledge graph. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to propose a dedicated task for improving model performance on Visual Commonsense Generation. Experimental results show that by pretraining, our model reaches state-of-the-art performance on the Visual Commonsense Generation task.

Wireless networks are a key component of the telecommunications infrastructure in our society, and wireless services become increasingly important as the applications of wireless devices have penetrated every aspect of our lives. Although wireless technologies have significantly advanced in the past decades, most wireless networks are still vulnerable to radio jamming attacks due to the openness nature of wireless channels, and the progress in the design of jamming-resistant wireless networking systems remains limited. This stagnation can be attributed to the lack of practical physical-layer wireless technologies that can efficiently decode data packets in the presence of jamming attacks. This article surveys existing jamming attacks and anti-jamming strategies in wireless local area networks (WLANs), cellular networks, cognitive radio networks (CRNs), ZigBee networks, Bluetooth networks, vehicular networks, LoRa networks, RFID networks, and GPS system, with the objective of offering a comprehensive knowledge landscape of existing jamming/anti-jamming strategies and stimulating more research efforts to secure wireless networks against jamming attacks. Different from prior survey papers, this article conducts a comprehensive, in-depth review on jamming and anti-jamming strategies, casting insights on the design of jamming-resilient wireless networking systems. An outlook on promising antijamming techniques is offered at the end of this article to delineate important research directions.

A major strategy to prevent the spread of COVID-19 is through the limiting of in-person contacts. However, for the many disabled people who live in the community and require caregivers to assist them with activities of daily living, limiting contacts is impractical or impossible. We seek to determine which interventions can prevent infections among disabled people and their caregivers. To accomplish this, we simulate COVID-19 transmission with a compartmental model on a network. The networks incorporate heterogeneity in the risks of different types of interactions, time-dependent lockdown and reopening measures, and interaction distributions for four different groups (caregivers, disabled people, essential workers, and the general population). Among these groups, we find the probability of becoming infected is highest for caregivers and second highest for disabled people. Our analysis of the network structure illustrates that caregivers have the largest modal eigenvector centrality among the four groups. We find that two interventions -- contact-limiting by all groups and mask-wearing by disabled people and caregivers -- particularly reduce cases among disabled people and caregivers. We also test which group most effectively spreads COVID-19 by seeding infections in a subset of each group and then comparing the total number of infections as the disease spreads. We find that caregivers are the most effective spreaders of COVID-19. We then test where limited vaccine doses could be used most effectively and we find that vaccinating caregivers better protects disabled people than vaccinating the general population, essential workers, or the disabled population itself. Our results highlight the potential effectiveness of mask-wearing, contact-limiting throughout society, and strategic vaccination for limiting the exposure of disabled people and their caregivers to COVID-19.

Deep, heavily overparameterized language models such as BERT, XLNet and T5 have achieved impressive success in many NLP tasks. However, their high model complexity requires enormous computation resources and extremely long training time for both pre-training and fine-tuning. Many works have studied model compression on large NLP models, but only focus on reducing inference cost/time, while still requiring expensive training process. Other works use extremely large batch sizes to shorten the pre-training time at the expense of high demand for computation resources. In this paper, inspired by the Early-Bird Lottery Tickets studied for computer vision tasks, we propose EarlyBERT, a general computationally-efficient training algorithm applicable to both pre-training and fine-tuning of large-scale language models. We are the first to identify structured winning tickets in the early stage of BERT training, and use them for efficient training. Comprehensive pre-training and fine-tuning experiments on GLUE and SQuAD downstream tasks show that EarlyBERT easily achieves comparable performance to standard BERT with 35~45% less training time.

This paper presents a detailed study of improving visual representations for vision language (VL) tasks and develops an improved object detection model to provide object-centric representations of images. Compared to the most widely used \emph{bottom-up and top-down} model \cite{anderson2018bottom}, the new model is bigger, better-designed for VL tasks, and pre-trained on much larger training corpora that combine multiple public annotated object detection datasets. Therefore, it can generate representations of a richer collection of visual objects and concepts. While previous VL research focuses mainly on improving the vision-language fusion model and leaves the object detection model improvement untouched, we show that visual features matter significantly in VL models. In our experiments we feed the visual features generated by the new object detection model into a Transformer-based VL fusion model \oscar \cite{li2020oscar}, and utilize an improved approach \short\ to pre-train the VL model and fine-tune it on a wide range of downstream VL tasks. Our results show that the new visual features significantly improve the performance across all VL tasks, creating new state-of-the-art results on seven public benchmarks. We will release the new object detection model to public.

Researchers and practitioners across many disciplines have recently adopted computational notebooks to develop, document, and share their scientific workflows - and the GIS community is no exception. This chapter introduces computational notebooks in the geographical context. It begins by explaining the computational paradigm and philosophy that underlie notebooks. Next it unpacks their architecture to illustrate a notebook user's typical workflow. Then it discusses the main benefits notebooks offer GIS researchers and practitioners, including better integration with modern software, more natural access to new forms of data, and better alignment with the principles and benefits of open science. In this context, it identifies notebooks as the glue that binds together a broader ecosystem of open source packages and transferable platforms for computational geography. The chapter concludes with a brief illustration of using notebooks for a set of basic GIS operations. Compared to traditional desktop GIS, notebooks can make spatial analysis more nimble, extensible, and reproducible and have thus evolved into an important component of the geospatial science toolkit.

Methods for stochastic trace estimation often require the repeated evaluation of expressions of the form $z^T p_n(A)z$, where $A$ is a symmetric matrix and $p_n$ is a degree $n$ polynomial written in the standard or Chebyshev basis. We show how to evaluate these expressions using only $\lceil n/2\rceil$ matrix-vector products, thus substantially reducing the cost of existing trace estimation algorithms that use Chebyshev interpolation or Taylor series.

# 10. A p-adaptive, implicit-explicit mixed finite element method for  reaction-diffusion problems

- [math.NA](https://arxiv.org/list/math.NA/recent)

A new class of implicit-explicit (IMEX) methods combined with a p-adaptive mixed finite element formulation is proposed to simulate the diffusion of reacting species. Hierarchical polynomial functions are used to construct an $H(\mathrm{Div})$-conforming base for the flux vectors, and a non-conforming $L^2$ base for the mass concentration of the species. The mixed formulation captures the distinct nonlinearities associated with the constitutive flux equations and the reaction terms. The IMEX method conveniently treats these two sources of nonlinearity implicitly and explicitly, respectively, within a single time-stepping framework. The combination of the p-adaptive mixed formulation and the IMEX method delivers a robust and efficient algorithm. The proposed methods eliminate the coupled effect of mesh size and time step on the algorithmic stability. A residual based a posteriori error estimate that provides an upper bound of the natural error norm is derived. The availability of such estimate which can be obtained with minimal computational effort and the hierarchical construction of the finite element spaces allow for the formulation of an efficient p-adaptive algorithm. A series of numerical examples demonstrate the performance of the approach. It is shown that the method with the p-adaptive strategy accurately solves problems involving travelling waves, and those with discontinuities and singularities. The flexibility of the formulation is also illustrated via selected applications in pattern formation and electrophysiology.

Recent work on training neural retrievers for open-domain question answering (OpenQA) has employed both supervised and unsupervised approaches. However, it remains unclear how unsupervised and supervised methods can be used most effectively for neural retrievers. In this work, we systematically study retriever pre-training. We first propose an approach of unsupervised pre-training with the Inverse Cloze Task and masked salient spans, followed by supervised finetuning using question-context pairs. This approach leads to absolute gains of 2+ points over the previous best result in the top-20 retrieval accuracy on Natural Questions and TriviaQA datasets.   We also explore two approaches for end-to-end supervised training of the reader and retriever components in OpenQA models. In the first approach, the reader considers each retrieved document separately while in the second approach, the reader considers all the retrieved documents together. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of these approaches as we obtain new state-of-the-art results. On the Natural Questions dataset, we obtain a top-20 retrieval accuracy of 84, an improvement of 5 points over the recent DPR model. In addition, we achieve good results on answer extraction, outperforming recent models like REALM and RAG by 3+ points. We further scale up end-to-end training to large models and show consistent gains in performance over smaller models.

We consider a one-hidden-layer leaky ReLU network of arbitrary width trained by stochastic gradient descent following an arbitrary initialization. We prove that stochastic gradient descent (SGD) produces neural networks that have classification accuracy competitive with that of the best halfspace over the distribution for a broad class of distributions that includes log-concave isotropic and hard margin distributions. Equivalently, such networks can generalize when the data distribution is linearly separable but corrupted with adversarial label noise, despite the capacity to overfit. We conduct experiments which suggest that for some distributions our generalization bounds are nearly tight. This is the first result that shows that overparameterized neural networks trained by SGD can generalize when the data is corrupted with adversarial label noise.
